The central topic once again will be on infrastructure. Last time we managed
to overhaul the way GAP releases are made, and also the website
infrastructure, which was overall a great success.

This time the focus will be on the GAP package distribution. Some things we could tackle:
* simplifying the process for depositing packages resp. submitting them for
  review (for both sides, package authors and the GAP team), e.g. by automating
  more of it, documenting it better
* revive the continuous testing of GAP changes against all distributed
  packages (so that we notice regressions caused by changes in GAP or in
  packages quicker)
* revising the technical setup for the package distribution (were it is stored, how it gets updated, etc.)
* overhaul how the GAP website lists and presents the packages in the distribution

As always, participants can also work on other things, but the above will be
the primary focus of the workshop.
